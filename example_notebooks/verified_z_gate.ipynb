    "# Verified Z Gate\n",
    "Here we exemplify how a verified CNOT can be implemented. First we construct the usual MBQC pattern for a Z gate. This is a three quibt graph state with the first quibt measured in a rotated basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we also include an `vertex_is_dummy_list`. This list can be thought of as a colouring of the graph. In particular each sub list corresponds to a colour, with a vertex being dummy when the corresponding entry in the list is `True`. Each vertex should be coloured by one of the sub lists, which it to say is `False` atleast once."
